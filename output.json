Their relationship feels genuine, the conversations between them are enjoyable, and almost all of the intended comedic moments land perfectly, which is something most video games seem to have trouble with."

I\u2019d think about the gods I should look for and the characters I wanted to learn about, I\u2019d think about the next weapon I should try and how frustrating a certain boss was. Then, I\u2019d sit down and play again, losing myself in a world that I could consistently feel myself getting better at. And once I still think about the first time I fully completed a run, beating the final boss. That feeling of accomplishment is something to be celebrated and appreciated."

That\u2019s not only due to the rock-solid gameplay foundation, with its flexible class system, versatile weapons and progression mechanics. It\u2019s also not only because of the morbid, dense atmosphere and the mysterious, captivating setting. It isn\u2019t even solely the open world, which makes me want to spend every spare second exploring it with its gorgeous, monumental vistas and densely packed locations. Instead, the masterful combination of all these great qualities is what really makes Elden Ring special. Yes, the game has stopped me in my tracks multiple times, forcing me to leave bosses and places for later due to the somewhat slower progression system. But every time it does, it offers up dozens of other locations to test my mettle, become stronger and more skilled. And this cycle of trial and triumph is so immensely engaging that it\u2019s going to keep me entertained for months to come."
